## Introduction

MetaCyto is an R package that performs meta-analysis of cytometry data. It is able to work with both flow cytometry data and CyTOF data. MetaCyto can also be used to analyze cytometry data from a single experiment. 



## Installation

To install the MetaCyto package, please open the “MetaCyto.Rproj” file in “MetaCyto_Package” folder and click Build&Reload button in RStudio. 


## Examples

Three simple examples are created to show users how to use MetaCyto for different purposes.


* **MetaCyto_Example_Meta_Local:** This example shows how to perform meta-analysis using MetaCyto on your local datasets. 



* **MetaCyto_Example_Meta_ImmPort:** This example shows how to use MetaCyto to meta-analyze cytometry data downloaded from ImmPort


* **MetaCyto_Example_One_Experiment:** This example shows how to use MetaCyto to analyze cytometry data from a single experiment. 



## Reference

Data used in the example is a subset of data from SDY420[1] and SDY736[2] on ImmPort[3].
